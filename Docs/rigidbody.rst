Rigid body
==========

Rigid bodies are the way to have dynamic interations with the fluid (other then changing the velocity field directly)

Static bodies
=============

Static bodies act on the fluid, but the fluid doesn't act on the fluid. This is called a weak coupling between the rigid body and the fluid.
They have a velocity that is imparted on the fluid. Think of motorized objects pushing through the fluid.

Dynamic bodies
==============

Dynamic bodies are affected by the fluid. They can also in turn, affect the fluid, which is called a strong coupling with the fluid.
