 * The code is divided in two namespaces: Fluid and Renderer.
 * The Renderer namespace has a few helper classes for OpenGL for the Fluid engine,
 * namely for handling Texture, Shader, RenderTexture, RenderTarget, Transformable, Drawable and its implementation
 * Rectangle and Circle.
 *
 * The main classes to look at for Fluid are Engine, Density, Buffer and Operator.
